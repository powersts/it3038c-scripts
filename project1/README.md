## This is my project 1

=====================

## Overview

### In this project I wrote a script that will tell you the current time.

=====================

## Instructions

### In order to run the code go to my github page https://github.com/powersts/it3038c-scripts and download my repository. You download the repository by clicking on "code" and in the dropdown there will be a "Download ZIP" option.

### Once you have the ZIP downloaded, extract only the project1.py and save it in a folder on your C:\ drive.

### Open Visual Studio Code, if you do not have it downloaded go to this link to download it https://code.visualstudio.com/download, and open the file.

### Once you have the file open in Visual Studio Code you can run the code.

### The final output should look like
```python
"It is currently (Current time)"
```
### After you call the script it will output the time it currently is.
