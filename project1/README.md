## This is my project 1

=====================

## Overview

### In this project I wrote a script that will tell you the current time.

=====================

## Instructions

### In order to run the code go to my github page https://github.com/powersts/it3038c-scripts and download my repository. You download the repository by clicking on "code" and in the dropdown there will be a "Download ZIP" option.

### Once you have the ZIP downloaded, extract only the project1.py to your desktop.

### Open Powershell and navigate to the Desktop
```powershell
cd C:\Users\<name>\Desktop
```
### Once you have navigated to the Desktop, you will be able to call the script by typing in
```python
python project1.py
```

### The final output should look like
```python
C:\users\<name>\Desktop> project1.py
"It is currently (Current time)"
```
### After you call the script it will output the time it currently is.
