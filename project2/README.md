## This is my project 2

=====================

## Overview 

### In this project I expanded upon my project 1 python script that showed the current time. The script will now show you current date and current time.

=====================

## Instructions

### In order to run the code go to my github page https://github.com/powersts/it3038c-scripts and download my repository. You download the repository by clicking on "code" and in the dropdown there will be a "Download ZIP" option.

### Once you have the ZIP downloaded, extract only the project2.py and save it in a folder on your C:\ drive.

### Open Visual Studio Code, if you do not have it downloaded go to this link to download it https://code.visualstudio.com/download, and open the file.

### Once you have the file open in Visual Studio Code you can run the code by clicking the play button in the top right.

### The final output should look like
```python
"The date is: (Current Date)"
"It is currently (Current time)"
```
### After you call the script it will output the time it currently is.
