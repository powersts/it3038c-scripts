## This is my project 3

=====================

## Overview 

### In this project I expanded upon my project second. Originally it showed the time and date within the command line, but now it opens a flask page which will show you then date and time.

=====================

## Instructions

### In order to run the code go to my github page https://github.com/powersts/it3038c-scripts and download my repository. You can download the repository by clicking on "code" and in the dropdown there will be a "Download ZIP" option.

### Once you have the ZIP downloaded, extract the project3 folder and save it in a folder on your C:\ drive.

### Open Visual Studio Code, if you do not have it downloaded go to this link to download it https://code.visualstudio.com/download.

### Once Visual Studio Code is open, open the webPage.py file from the project3 folder.

### After the file opens in Visual Studio Code click the play button in the top right and it will start a flask server.

### It will display the address within the command line and you can either control + click the address or you can browse to it using chrome or firefox.

### Once the page is open, it will ask you if you want to see the current time, click the button that says "Yes!".

### After you click the button it will take you to a new page that will show you the current time and date.
